<p>The production stage is a lengthy process that can span over a period of 16 years.  The large startup costs involved from mining projects are heavily reliant on the efficiency and performance of the mineral extraction. These costs are required to generate the much-needed funds to satisfy stakeholders. The production process requires maximum utilization of specialized equipment and machinery. To ensure operations are effective, efficient and safe; important operational activities must be in place.</p>

<br>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<ul>
<li>Environmental Management Systems - Ensures operations are closely monitored and tested to local standards. For instance, in WA there are specific legislations and compliance requirements that companies must adhere too. </li>
<li>Safety Management - The welfare of workers is heavily dependent on high safety standards and strict auditing to maintain a safe operating environment. </li>
<li>Preventative Maintenance - A critical activity to ensure equipment is available, efficient and performs to the expected standard. The preventative maintenance is a process that requires continuous monitoring throughout the production stage. It is primarily focused on specialized machinery and equipment that requires preventative maintenance.</li>
<li>Asset Management - Tracking and monitoring the lifespan of equipment allows for better judgement in CAPEX planning and fulfilment with organising budgeting processes and stakeholders’ expectations. </li>
<li>Training - Ongoing training and self-development are critical in all stages of a project. It allows for reflection and preventative procedures to mitigate the damage of incident incurrence. Simulations and technology are used to ensure expensive equipment are not used by untrained personnel.</li>
<li>Remote Control Management - Management of automated mining machinery and equipment require specialized equipment and machinery. Also required specialised systems in place to monitor status of equipment and the state of the machinery. </li>
<li>Mine Production Management – Tracking and management of materials is critical for the production process to ensure data can be collated and interpreted. This includes streamlined reconciliation, reporting, auditing processes and greater visibility for stakeholders. </li>

</ul>

<h2>Western Australia</h2>
<p>In WA, the major commodities include; Iron ore, petroleum, and gold. Each commodity has a different process of extraction; however, similar activities are required to achieve high production rates, performance and efficiency. Safety measures not kept up to standards can lead to costly reactive measures (frequently caused by equipment failure). </p>
