<p>Before the construction stage of the Mining Lifecycle can begin, all the necessary documentation, permits, and
    capital investments must be approved. The construction phase itself is comprised of the preliminary construction and
    mine construction phases. The construction phase of the Mine Lifecycle can cost upwards of $1.5 billion and usually
    lasts for over 3 years depending on the size of the project.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Activities</h2>

<p>The activities that make up the preliminary construction phase includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Staffing – the recruitment of appropriate professionals for on site management.</li>
    <li>Demolition – removal of old structures and buildings.</li>
    <li>Building transportation infrastructure – this includes different modes of transport like roads, bridges,
        railways and ports.</li>
    <li>Environmental and land management – begins during the preliminary construction phase and consists of the
        activity’s miners must adhere to pertaining to the relocation of wildlife and plantation.</li>
    <li>Procurement of equipment – ordering and obtaining mining equipment such as drill rigs, mills, and light and
        heavy diesel vehicles.
    </li>

</ul>

<br>

<p>Some of the activities in the mine construction phase will change across different projects depending on the type of
    mine to be constructed. The two different mines are an open pit (surface) or an underground mine. The common
    activities of the mine construction phase include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Construction of facilities – development of specific facilities for:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Mineral and ore processing.</li>
        <li>Disposables and waste management.</li>
        <li>On-site power generation.</li>
        <li>Permanent employee housing and emergency response.</li>
        <li>Equipment and vehicle storage and maintenance.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<br>

<p>Activities included in the construction of an open pit mine consist of:</p>
<ul>

    <li>Drilling holes and placing explosives into them.</li>
    <li>After detonating the explosives, the broken rock is loaded into trucks.</li>
    <li>The ores and minerals are sent to the processing facilities.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>Activities included in the construction of underground mines consist of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Drilling holes to make a tunnel, shaft or decline.</li>
    <li>Removal of any loose rock in mining areas termed "stopes".</li>
    <li>Developing ground support in stopes to ensure flooring stability.</li>
    <li>After mining in each stope is complete, a mixture is used to backfill the open area.</li>

</ul>

<br>

<h2>Operational Activities</h2>
<p>All phases of the mine lifecycle have operational requirements that may overlap with other stages while also having a
    specific focus on specific operational activities. Operational activities that are required in the construction
    stage include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Capital asset management – as the construction phase is the most capital-intensive stage in the mine lifecycle,
        being able to track assets ensures that there is optimal uptime and use of all equipment as well as ensuring
        assets are maintained.</li>
    <li>Human resource management – mining projects, especially in the construction phase will require the employment of
        many workers no matter the size of the mine being developed. Implementing effective processes in to manage
        workers is key to any organisation’s success.</li>
    <li>Financial reporting – reporting and purchasing controls are required during this phase as it can be the most
        expensive stage in the mine lifecycle.</li>
    <li>Recruitment – having the most technically skilled personnel ensures that all employees are competent to meet
        requirements.</li>
    <li>Regulation – all operations during the construction phase must adhere to specific guidelines pertaining to
        environmental and waste management as well as occupational and mine safety management.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Western Australia</h2>
<p>According to the Department of Jobs and Small Business, the mining industry employs around 250,000 people which makes
    up for approximately 2.0% of Australia’s total workforce. As more projects obtain the green light, Australia will
    face an economic boom as more jobs for the population is created.
    The table below illustrate some examples of mine projects that have been approved in Western Australia.
