<p>The Development stage of the Mining Lifecycle consists of the commencement of the mining activities. This activity
    can take between 4 – 12 years and can cost anywhere between one million to one billion (depending on the mine type
    and size). The construction of the mine site occurs within this stage – signaling the commencement of the mineral
    extraction.</p>

<br>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>At the development stage, the activities aim to ensure that there is no interruption happening in the period of
    performing the productive for the life of the mine.
</p>

<br>

<p>The activities in this stage involves:</p>
<ol>

<li>Defining - determine the mining technology that will be used.</li>
<li>Constructing - building of access roads for transportation.</li>
<li>Identifying – recognizing resources including electricity, water sources etc.</li>
<li>Building – constructing ore processing facilities as well as the waste disposal areas.</li>
</ol>

<br>

<h2>Operational Activities</h2>
<p>The financial and accounting departments are heavily involved within this stage. An analysis of the overall costs regarding the mining endeavor needs to be stringently assessed, and the social and environmental impacts needing to be considered.</p>

<p>The primary operation activities should include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Obtaining water and mineral rights</li>
<li>Purchasing surface lands</li>
<li>Arranging for financing</li>
<li>Preparing permit applications and environment impact statement (EIS)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Infographic</h2>
<p>The below infographic shows the relationship between project value and time taken to complete the mining lifecycle. The risk of a project gradually decreasing from exploration to closure while the project value presents the reverse trend. At the development stage, risk is the dominant element to determine the success of the whole mining project.</p>

<h2>Mine Budget Control in WA</h2>
<p>In general, the expenditure of mining is between $1 million to $1 billion, which depends to the type and size. As part of budget, environmental rehabilitation occupies a non-negligible proportion. Based on diverse category of land disturbances, the MRF (Mining Rehabilitation Fund) levy has different fund contribution rate as the table shown below.</p>
