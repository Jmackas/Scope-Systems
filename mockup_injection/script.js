The construction phase itself is comprised of the preliminary construction and mine construction phases. The construction phase of the Mine Lifecycle can cost upwards of $1.5 billion and usually lasts for over 3 years depending on the size of the project.</p><br><h2>Activities</h2><p>The activities that make up the preliminary construction phase includes:</p><ul> <li>Staffing – the recruitment of appropriate professionals for on site management.</li> <li>Demolition – removal of old structures and buildings.</li> <li>Building transportation infrastructure – this includes different modes of transport like roads, bridges, railways and ports.</li> <li>Environmental and land management – begins during the preliminary construction phase and consists of the activity’s miners must adhere to pertaining to the relocation of wildlife and plantation.</li> <li>Procurement of equipment – ordering and obtaining mining equipment such as drill rigs, mills, and light and heavy diesel vehicles. </li></ul><br><p>Some of the activities in the mine construction phase will change across different projects depending on the type of mine to be constructed. The two different mines are an open pit (surface) or an underground mine.

Operational activities that are required in the construction stage include:</p><ul> <li>Capital asset management – as the construction phase is the most capital-intensive stage in the mine lifecycle, being able to track assets ensures that there is optimal uptime and use of all equipment as well as ensuring assets are maintained.</li> <li>Human resource management – mining projects, especially in the construction phase will require the employment of many workers no matter the size of the mine being developed. Implementing effective processes in to manage workers is key to any organisation’s success.</li> <li>Financial reporting – reporting and purchasing controls are required during this phase as it can be the most expensive stage in the mine lifecycle.</li> <li>Recruitment – having the most technically skilled personnel ensures that all employees are competent to meet requirements.</li> <li>Regulation – all operations during the construction phase must adhere to specific guidelines pertaining to environmental and waste management as well as occupational and mine safety management.</li></ul><br><h2>Western Australia</h2><p>According to the Department of Jobs and Small Business, the mining industry employs around 250,000 people which makes up for approximately 2.0% of Australia’s total workforce.

The large startup costs involved from mining projects are heavily reliant on the efficiency and performance of the mineral extraction. These costs are required to generate the much-needed funds to satisfy stakeholders. The production process requires maximum utilization of specialized equipment and machinery. To ensure operations are effective, efficient and safe; important operational activities must be in place.</p><br><h2>Activities</h2><ul><li>Environmental Management Systems - Ensures operations are closely monitored and tested to local standards. For instance, in WA there are specific legislations and compliance requirements that companies must adhere too. </li><li>Safety Management - The welfare of workers is heavily dependent on high safety standards and strict auditing to maintain a safe operating environment. </li><li>Preventative Maintenance - A critical activity to ensure equipment is available, efficient and performs to the expected standard. The preventative maintenance is a process that requires continuous monitoring throughout the production stage. It is primarily focused on specialized machinery and equipment that requires preventative maintenance.</li><li>Asset Management - Tracking and monitoring the lifespan of equipment allows for better judgement in CAPEX planning and fulfilment with organising budgeting processes and stakeholders’ expectations. </li><li>Training - Ongoing training and self-development are critical in all stages of a project. It allows for reflection and preventative procedures to mitigate the damage of incident incurrence. Simulations and technology are used to ensure expensive equipment are not used by untrained personnel.</li><li>Remote Control Management - Management of automated mining machinery and equipment require specialized equipment and machinery. Also required specialised systems in place to monitor status of equipment and the state of the machinery. </li><li>Mine Production Management – Tracking and management of materials is critical for the production process to ensure data can be collated and interpreted. This includes streamlined reconciliation, reporting, auditing processes and greater visibility for stakeholders. </li></ul><br><h2>The Process</h2><p>In WA, the major commodities include; Iron ore, petroleum, and gold. Each commodity has a different process of extraction; however, similar activities are required to achieve high production rates, performance and efficiency. Safety measures not kept up to standards can lead to costly reactive measures (frequently caused by equipment failure). </p>';
