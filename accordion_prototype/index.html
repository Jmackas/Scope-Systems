    <!-- Exploration -->
    <button class="accordion exploration">Exploration</button>
    <div class="droppanel">
        <p>The exploration stage of the Mining Lifecycle consists of the initial analysis of prospective territory,
            determining if it contains a worthwhile amount of minerals to be mined. The analysis of the territory can
            take between two to eight years and can cost up to $15 million – a value which may yield little return. A
            feasibility report will need to be generated from the geologists, determining if the prospective site has
            mining potential. </p>

    <!-- Development -->
    <button class="accordion development">Development</button>
    <div class="droppanel">
        <p>The Development stage of the Mining Lifecycle consists of the commencement of the mining activities. This activity can take between 4 – 12 years and can cost anywhere between one million to one billion (depending on the mine type and size). The construction of the mine site occurs within this stage – signaling the commencement of the mineral extraction. </p>

    <!-- Construction -->
    <button class="accordion construction">Construction</button>
    <div class="droppanel">
        <p>Before the construction stage of the Mining Lifecycle can begin, all the necessary documentation, permits, and capital investments must be approved. The construction phase itself is comprised of the preliminary construction and mine construction phases. The construction phase of the Mine Lifecycle can cost upwards of $1.5 billion and usually lasts for over 3 years depending on the size of the project. </p>

    <!-- Production -->
    <button class="accordion production">Production</button>
    <div class="droppanel">
        <p>The production stage is a lengthy process that can span over a period of 16 years.  The large startup costs involved from mining projects are heavily reliant on the efficiency and performance of the mineral extraction. These costs are required to generate the much-needed funds to satisfy stakeholders. The production process requires maximum utilization of specialized equipment and machinery. To ensure operations are effective, efficient and safe; important operational activities must be in place.</p>
